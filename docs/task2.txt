Code review:

0. The documentation states that the endpoint accepted method is POST, yet this code is making a GET request, that won't be accepted.
    You must change it to send a POST request.
    Consider using a HTTP client like Guzzle or cURL to make the request.

1. You are calling the function `file_get_contents` without checking if there was any error.
    You should always check if there was any error after calling that function.

2. You are passing credentials in the query string directly.
Those values should be stored in configuration files or environment variables instead of being hardcoded.

3. The variable `name` is not being encoded. You can use the `urlencode` function to encode it,
    but the better approach would be to just use the function `http_build_query` to encode all the parameters.
