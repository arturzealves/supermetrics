Would you use a class/library provided by an external framework in your code, why or why not?

It depends on the complexity of the feature and how time consuming it is to have the same functionality implemented internally.

If the external library is a well known and widely used library, then it is a good practice to use it because it will save me time
implementing the needed feature and will most likely be better implemented, more efficient and more secure, because usually these
libraries are open-source and mantained by a lot of people.

If otherwise the library is not known yet, we still need to consider the pros and cons of using it.
Using it will bind our project to that dependency and we will adopt all the vulnerabilities that the library has.

When in doubt, the safest thing to do is to not use a suspicious library.
It is better to read the code, find the parts that we need to implement in our project and write it ourselves.

Another good approach to do this is to fork the code from the needed library and adapt it to our needs, if needed.
This way we can maintain it ourselves and not be dependent on others, specially if the library is not being mantained regularly.
